# twitterThreadCon
To generate a thread of conversation for a given tweet (through its URL) recursively till the end node and generate the output in a file, by general web scraping.

## Intention
This code is intended to generate the replies recursively till the end nodes (tweets with no further replies).

## Required Input:
Input should be of the form: "https://www.twitter.com/user_name_here/status/tweet_ID_here"

## Planned Additions:
1. Adding a GUI module
2. Replacing requests module with selenium as multiple requests are not handled properly

2. openpyxl
3. BeautifulSoup4

### Side note:
This is a side project of mine, so feel free to issue any pull requests for any module you feel can be improved.
